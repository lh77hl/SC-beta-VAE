# SC-beta-VAE
References of "Variational auto-encoders based on the shift correction for imputation of specific missing in multivariate time series" by Li et al. 

I creat 4 branches, and the general content of each branch is described below. 

1. The summary of open source works.xlsx

I summarize an Excel table to upload the imputation toolkits used in this manuscript, and some useful open source toolkits and data sources, including Autoimpute, DataWig, the two-step verifiable imputation process and so on.

2. fancyimpute

It is a third-party toolkit of python, which mainly provides the implementation of various imputation methods such as SimpleFill(Mean)、SoftImpute、KNN and so on.

3. missingpy

It is a library for missing data imputation in Python, including Random Forest and KNN. It has an API consistent with scikit-learn.

4. generative models

I upload some codes of generative models used in this manuscript, including VAE、DAE、GAN、W-GAN and AVB.
